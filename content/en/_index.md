We are communists, specifically akin to the Communist Left. The purpose of the site is to collect in a light, accessible and rational format the theoretical material inherent in the movement that abolishes the current state of things. If anyone in our group ever goes to the trouble of engaging in revolutionary prose, this site is designed for that too. For questions write to the email address located at the bottom of the page.
